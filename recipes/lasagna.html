        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>World's Best Lasagna is a rich, hearty, and deeply satisfying dish that layers bold Italian flavors in every bite. This classic recipe begins with a robust, slow-simmered meat sauce made from a blend of ground beef and Italian sausage, perfectly seasoned with garlic, onions, crushed tomatoes, and a medley of Italian herbs. The sauce is then generously layered between sheets of tender lasagna noodles and a creamy ricotta cheese mixture enriched with Parmesan and fresh parsley. Each layer builds depth and comfort, finishing with a bubbling, golden top of melted mozzarella cheese.</p>
